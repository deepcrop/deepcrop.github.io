## Intro to Digital Agro

The agriculture and food sector is facing multiple challenges. With the global population projected to grow
from 7.6 billion in 2018 to over 9.6 billion in 2050 there will be a significant increase in the demand for food.
At the same time, the availability of natural resources such as fresh water and productive arable land is
becoming increasingly
constrained. This will require an urgent transformation of the current agrifood system.
Digital innovations and technologies may be part of the solution. The so-called ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’
(Industry 4.0) is seeing several sectors rapidly transformed by ‘disruptive’ digital technologies such as
Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision.
This course will be focused on several milestone problems for Russian Agrifood sector, like:
- detection of harmful plants, yield prediction, and soil sampling optimization in open fields;
- plants grow prediction and plant recognition for greenhouses.
Students will try to improve and solve this issue on a real cases and real BigData.
